# Investigation data warehouse for South Africa

This repository contains a wide selection of public data from the RSA, as well as the necessary scripts to load it to a database and to analyze it.

## Data Sources

The data is partially extracted from public sources, and from semi-public data sources.

### SA NPO Registry Scraper

This is a scraper for the South African government's database of non-political organisations (NPOs). The code is extracted from the Siyazana project because it may be useful on its own.
